# eiaSteroids
Welcome to this example project demonstrating the skills taught in the course  
**Entwicklung interaktiver Anwendungen II (EIA2)**  
at the Hochschule Furtwangen University (HFU)  
to the students of the subject Medienkonzeption (MKB)  

## Design
Most prominent are the skills to design complex software solutions using UML diagrams, specifically Use-Case, Activity- and Class-Diagrams. Thus, browse the design documentation first:  

- [Design](Documentation/Design.pdf)  

## Production
Programming skills are required to prove the designs and to reiterate them. Also a designer must be capable of creating prototypes herself in order to tinker and come up with new ideas. Here is the game designed:
